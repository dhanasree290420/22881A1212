🧩 Design Document
Project Title: Frontend Test Submission
Author: G. Dhanasree
Roll No: 22881A1212

1. 📌 Objective
Build a responsive React-based frontend application to demonstrate skills in component-based architecture, logging, and client-side data persistence.

2. 🧱 Architectural Design Choices
Component-Based Architecture:
The app is broken into reusable components such as Navbar, ClientList, AddClientForm, and ClientCard.

Single Page Application (SPA):
Uses React Router for client-side routing without reloading the page.

Middleware for Logging:
A custom logger.js is created to log all client interactions locally (console or file-based) to demonstrate middleware understanding.

3. ⚙️ Technology Stack
Tool	Reason
React	UI building using components and state management.
Vite	Fast build tool and dev server for React.
React Router	For page navigation (SPA behavior).
LocalStorage	To persist client data without backend API.
JavaScript (ES6+)	For logic, event handling, and structure.
HTML/CSS	For layout and responsive design.

4. 🗃️ Data Modeling & State Management
All client data is stored in localStorage in this format:

json
Copy code
{
  "clients": [
    {
      "id": "c1",
      "name": "John Doe",
      "email": "john@example.com",
      "joinedDate": "2025-07-28"
    }
  ]
}
